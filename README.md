# Iotsensorproject

Three applications to be tested :
  1. Messaging
  2. Youtube
  3. News/Reading
 
Sensors being used :
  1. Magentometer
  2. Gyroscope
  3. Gravity (to obtain the orientation)
  4. Rotation vector
 
 Gathering the results :
 in the code fileName = "akshita.txt"
 Change that to "AdamMsg.txt", "AdamYT.txt", "Adamread.txt" and  "DhruvMsg.txt", "DhruvYT.txt", "Dhruvread.txt"
 Everytime you change :
  1. go to build --> make project 
  2. then connect the device to your system -> then get the apk and install it to your mobile
  3. disconnect and run
  4. close the application and unistall it from the phone (to prevent it from reading unecessary stuff)
  5. connect the device -- go to views-> tool windows -> device file explorer
  6. data->data->com.example.akshita or <yourusername>.iotapplication->files (to get the results)
  7. upload the results to git or send by email to amaradapuveravenkat1@student.gsu.edu
